//Practice writing simple functions in TypeScript

//basics

/**
 * Computes and returns the area of the triangle given its base and height.
 */




/**
 * Consumes three numbers and produces their sum. If a number is negative, ignore it.
 */





/**
 * Returns true if the given number is a multiple of 3 or 7, false otherwise.
 */




//loops

/**
 * Multiplies two numbers together using for loop addition
 */




/**
 * Adds elements of an array using a for..of statement
 * Read about iterators here: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/iterators-and-generators.html
 */




//arrays

/**
 * Filters out all failing grades from a list of grades, assume failing grade is anything below a 70
 * Use the filter method to solve this problem!
 */




/**
 * Given a list of grades, adjust the grades if the last grade is less than 95.
 * Return new array with an extra 5 points to the last grade in the array if the grades need to be adjusted.
 * If the grades do not need to be adjusted, return a copy of the original array.
 * Do not use a loop to solve this problem!
 */




/**
 * Consumes an array of colors (e.g., 'red', 'purple') and returns true if ALL
 * the colors are either 'red', 'blue', or 'green'. If an empty list is given,
 * then return true.
 */




//strings

/**
 * Consumes a string and a keyword returns whether or not the string contains that word.
 * If the string is empty, return null.
 */




/**
 * Given a string, return a new string where "not " has been added to the
 * front. However, if the string already begins with "not", return the
 * string unchanged.
 */




/**
 * Given a string, return a new string where the first and last characters
 * have been exchanged.
 */
